### Install Instructions

1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/Usarneme/PierresVendorApp.Solution`
2. Enter the project directory `cd PierresVendorApp.Solution/PierresVendorApp`
3. Install dependencies with `dotnet restore`
4. Start the web server with `dotnet run`
5. Visit the website in your browser of choice (see console for details), typically at http://localhost:5000/

NOTE: If you have trouble accessing the website it is likely because your browser is warning you about an invalid SSL certificate. This project redirects you to an HTTPS site at port 5001 by default. Please check your browser's website for instructions on bypassing this warning; for example in Firefox you must Click on the Advanced button and then the "I understand the risks, take me to the site" link that will appear below the warning text. This app uses the default C# SSL certificate because this is a learning project; were it hosted on a real website it would require a real SSL cert to comply with browser security requirements.
